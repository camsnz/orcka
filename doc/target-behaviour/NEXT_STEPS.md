Suggested Next Steps Based on Your TODO
Looking at your expanded TODO list, here are the logical next implementations:

Immediate Priority:
ASCII Tree Visualization (orcka calculate --ascii)
Extend the existing DOT file generation to also output ASCII tree format
Show service dependencies and rebuild criteria in terminal-friendly format
Medium Priority:
Build Command (orcka build)
Wrapper around docker buildx bake with orcka configuration discovery
Auto-detect orcka.yml/docker-orcka.yml/docker-shas.yml files
Integrate with existing calculate functionality
Configuration Discovery
Implement the file search logic for multiple config file names
Add validation for Docker versions and buildx features
Future Expansion:
Full Orchestration Commands (orcka up, orcka down)
Docker Compose integration with bake file support
--extra-bake and --extra-compose parameter support
Would you like me to start implementing any of these next features, or do you have other priorities for the orcka tool?
